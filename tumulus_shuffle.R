# This is a very quick and (very) dirty piece of code to compute probabilities of alignments with stars 
# in a tumulus. Inspired by: https://hal.science/hal-03223357v3
#
# The general strategy is to load in memory some information about a tumulus (namely, the azimuths of 
# stones as seen from the center of the tumulus) and randomly shuffle these positions to check if the 
# alignments observed could happen by chance.
#
# The two things that the program needs are: 
# 
#   (1) A file describing the position of stones in the tumulus (tumulus_azimuths.csv)
#   (2) A file with the list of azimuths to consider (typically, azimuth for the rise/set of notable stars): objects.csv
#
#

# Change the next command (setwd) to point to the folder on your computer where you have downloaded the two csv files 
# that come with this code.

RESOLUTION <- 0.1 # Steps in resolution for angles calculation.

# Let's start by defining two functions that will be needed for these simulations.

# randomizePositions
#
# This function randomizes the position of stones on the circle.
# It takes as parameters: tz and minSpace.
# 
#   tz: a data frame containing the list of stones in the tumulus, with at least the following columns:
#       - az1 & az2: azimuths of the two ends of the stone, as seen from the center
#       - angSize: the angular size of the stone, as seen from the center (can be obtained easily by doing the difference of az2 and az1)
#
#   minSpace: the minimum angular separation between two stones. Default value is 3.0 degrees.
